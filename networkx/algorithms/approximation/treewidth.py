"""Functions for computing treewidth decomposition.
   
   Treewidth of an undirected graph is a number associated with the graph. It can be defined as the size of the largest vertex set (bag) in a tree decomposition of the graph minus one. 

`Wikipedia: Treewidth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth>`_

   The notions of treewidth and tree decomposition have gained their attractiveness partly because many graph and network problems that are intractable (e.g., NP-hard) on arbitrary graphs become efficiently solvable (e.g., with a linear time algorithm) when the treewidth of the input graphs is bounded by a constant.
